# invaders_must_die

using this tutorial as a starting point (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7qHwb7geIM) I am delving deeper and adding lots of new features to learn Bevy.

so far ive implemented 2d movement, bluetooth controller support and rapier2dphysics to implement newton's law of gravitation between objects with different collider shapes.


this is very much an experimnetal work in progress so doesn't necessarily work as expected!!
